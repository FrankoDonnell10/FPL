# FPL
Using Python and the Fantasy Premier League public API to get teams and league data.

fpl_h2h_league_stats returns results from each game week from your head to head mini league. Substitute your head to head league code into the URL in line 8 to return data related to your own league. This can be found on the Fanatsy Premier League website when you open you head to head league. The code will be in the URL e.g https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/556449/matches/h

fpl_h2h_fixtures does the same as the above but the output into excel has a different format.
